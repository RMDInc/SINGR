Version 2.00 	- Fixed basic errors and started the code at Version 2.00 to give a place to start the versioning. 
	+ I'm still unsure how to assign version numbers to the software; I need to think about this more. In this version of the software, all the code pertaining to the SINGR devkit and gui have been committed, along with some instructions. 

Version 2.01	- Cleaned up the github repo a lot; untracked many files; fixed looping problem by adding code (which got deleted) that initialized the system. Changed the format of echo.c so that it prints out waveform data of any type over the ethernet connection. Sam added GPIO_20 which gives the size of the "write pointer" for the WF buffer. This gives us how many bytes to send over the ethernet; previously the system printed out the entire 16k bytes of the buffer. 
	+ This is tested on Graham's computer; needs verification on lab setup.
	+ tested on board uZ C1618

 Version 2.10	- This is a release version of the devkit and the GUI. This version (2.10) matches up with the GUI version (2.10). This software is what was used at Goddard SFC in August/September of 2017. This software set (devkit + GUI) were also used in tests at Mass General Hospital in their beamline.
	+ The devkit takes serial input from the GUI and performs the appropriate action. See the source code for more information; I hope to release a small write up with the serial commands in the future, but in the mean time, the source code comments and email may be the easiest way to get this information. 
	+ Many changes have been implemented since this code was uploaded; the main menu options have mostly stayed the same, but now all modes of data acquisition are available.

Version 2.11	- Removed an aesthetic feature. This version is the same a version 2.10

Version 2.12	- Changed the start up value of the full integral to allow the integration times to be set upon start up. Without this change, the system would not output data, only 0's, until the integration times were set. This has been corrected with this update.
